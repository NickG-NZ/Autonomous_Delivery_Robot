List of things to do
====================

- Change the RVIZ configuration to display the "flag_visualizer" topic
	-> Can manually edit asl_turtlebot/launch/project_rviz.rviz
	 	This is called by final_rviz.launch

	-> Can load up a blank rviz, turn on the topics we want, save the configuration
		then overwrite project_rviz.rviz with this new configuration
