List of things to do
====================

- Change the RVIZ configuration to display the "flag_visualizer" topic
	-> Can manually edit asl_turtlebot/launch/project_rviz.rviz
	 	This is called by final_rviz.launch

	-> Can load up a blank rviz, turn on the topics we want, save the configuration
		then overwrite project_rviz.rviz with this new configuration


- Implement FlagVisualizer node (display_flag_locations.py)

- Implement FlagLocalizer node (flag_localizer.py)

- Write new launch file

- Make sure "state_change" topic is correct

- Check camera parameters are correct (detector_mobilenet.py)
	project_pixel_to_ray takes in u,v in pixel counts
	self.cx, etc also need to be in pixel counts
