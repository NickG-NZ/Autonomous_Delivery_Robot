List of things to do
====================

- Change the RVIZ configuration to display the "flag_visualizer" topic
	-> Can manually edit asl_turtlebot/launch/project_rviz.rviz
	 	This is called by final_rviz.launch

	-> Can load up a blank rviz, turn on the topics we want, save the configuration
		then overwrite project_rviz.rviz with this new configuration

- Write new launch file

- Make sure "state_change" topic name (from Jason) is correct for determining when to lock "oracle flags"


!!!IMPORTANT!!!
- Check camera parameters are correct ON COSMO (detector_mobilenet.py) 
- Pull update to detector_mobile_net (Piazza) (and possibly any others) to Cosmo
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

- Test the robot identifying our flag by spoofing the opponent location

- Write functionality to save OccupancyGrid map (add to navigator.py)

- Make sure opponent_pose is updated regularly enough for identifying opponent

- Check if we want to be able to change our guess of the opponents flag (eg. store the norm(diff) and overwrite flag if
	a different flag returns a lower norm diff later on etc.). Could just overwrite everytime a flag and the opponent are close.

- After the game starts, the oracle can still move flags, but the oracle flags dictionary becomes redundant 
	(If a flag which is in the oracle dict is moved, the oracle dict isn't updated accordingly)


- Check Flag Localization and Visualization nodes have appropriate run conditions

- Should GMapping continue to update map after the game starts?

Integrating TA code
