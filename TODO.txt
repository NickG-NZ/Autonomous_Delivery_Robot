List of things to do
====================

- Change the RVIZ configuration to display the "flag_visualizer" topic
	-> Can manually edit asl_turtlebot/launch/project_rviz.rviz
	 	This is called by final_rviz.launch

	-> Can load up a blank rviz, turn on the topics we want, save the configuration
		then overwrite project_rviz.rviz with this new configuration

- Write new launch file

- Make sure "state_change" topic name (from Jason) is correct for determinig when to lock "oracle flags"

- Check camera parameters are correct (detector_mobilenet.py)
	project_pixel_to_ray takes in u,v in pixel counts
	self.cx, etc also need to be in pixel counts

- Check that markers move on map when republished (not duplicated etc.)

- Pull update to detector (and possibly any others) to Cosmo

- Test the robot identifying our flag by spoofing the opponent location
